# ERa: Enzyme Receptor Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data for the diploma project aimed at analyzing enzyme receptors for drug design. The project uses computational chemistry techniques to understand the binding affinity of various ligands to a specific enzyme receptor.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- RDKit
- PySCeS
